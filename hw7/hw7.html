    <p>This map shows the number of farms across Maryland's 24 counties, as gathered from Maryland's open data website source. 
        I chose Maryland because I have family relatives who live there, and I chose the farm dataset because I love farmers markets and local produce, and I was interested in the geography of local goods production and where the farms produce the most goods. This map, as split by equal counts, show the North West has the highest concentration of local farms, one county including a total of 1300 farms! We can also see almost all counties are populated by farms, excluding Baltimore City.</p>
