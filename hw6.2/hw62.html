<h1>Homework 6pt2: Census data ratios and categories </h1>

<h3>Equal Count</h3>

    </a>
    <p>This map uses equal count categories to visualize this data. This method works by sorting a specified number of classes into equal categories, and matches a color to each category. Here, I told github to use five categories to classify the data, and we can see the largest concentration of counts is in the South-West of Kentucky. This shows that this area has the highest population of Black/African Americans in relation to total county population. A pro of this method is that we can see clear distributions of color across the map, but a con of this method is that groups that may vary widely are sorted into the same category because it is based on equal counts.</p>

<h3>Equal Interval</h3>

    </a>
    <p>This map uses equal interval categories to visualize, which divides a number of classes into equal intervals as QGIS determines. To execute this, I specified QGIS to use five classes and this method makes it easy for me to see equal bins of data and any potential outliers that may exist within the data. However, a con of this method is that it has a tendency to create classes that are not represented in the map, though this did not occur here. We can see this method portrays the map as mostly the same color (tan), where there are fewer darker colors compared to the dominant tan color. </p>

<h3>Natural Breaks</h3>

    </a>
    <p>This map shows our data in Natural Breaks, which QGIS formulates by finding natural breaks in the dataset. This method is good at detecting outliers in its own category, but natural break maps make it hard to visualize a distribution of data and it is not as good as Equal Count in terms of displaying outlier data. </p>
