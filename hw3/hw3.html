    <h1>In this project I learned how to display maps in different projections</h1>
    <p>To execute this, I used the QGIS software and changed the EPSG every time to create a new projection. I would type in the EPSG I desired and then chose the corresponding projection, which would often be the one with 'world' in the name. I then installed and applied the Indicatrix mapper with its base cusomizations and measurements. This would produce the longtitude and latitude lines as well as the corresponding circles at each 90° angle. I then used the print layout function to create a png of my map and export this to my desktop folder to then code within Visual Studio Code.
        For example, to visualize the Psuedo Mercator projection, I changed the EPSG to 3857 and then created a new 
        print layout and then exported the image and pasted it on this webpage. The projections I researched and observed
        are below.

    </p>
    
    <h2>WGS84 Projection</h2>
    <p>Based on our class exercises so far, I am assuming this is one of the most popular and widely used projection. The map below shows a majority of countries, including Antartica. The projection represents Earth's surface as a three-dimensional ellipsoid. The grid space appears to be at 90° angles, thus preserving direction. I believe this projection is based on a cylindrical model, where the axis is oriented North-South and the cylinder is tangential to the equator. </p>

    <h2>Psuedo Mercator</h2>
    <p>The pseudo mercator is also another popular projection used in class. We often alternate between this and the WGS84, and they both look similar visually. The psuedo mercator projection shows Antartica and the equator, distorts the shape of Greenland, and has a similar scale of distortion on the circles. The circles near the equator are uniform and smaller than the larger circles near the poles. This model is a conformal cylindrical projection, and it is good for navigational purposes and holding the shape of entities but it is poor at representing area.</p>

    <h2>Winkel Projection</h2>
    <p>This projection greatly differs visually from the previous two. The edges are curved, similar to how the Earth is shaped. I notice this maps circles seem to be stretched vertically, and the distortion on the circles is greater at the poles. I believe this is an azimuthal projection that is good at displaying global data due to the areas and shapes with only a small amount of distortion. I think this map would be good for greater trends across global data, such as analyzing climate or vegetation levels. We learned in class that this map projection is often used by National Geographic because it adequately compromises distance, direction, and area.</p>

    <h2>World Cylindrical Equal Area Projection</h2>
    <p>Based on the name, I can assume this projection depicts the world using a cylindrical model that preserves the area factor. This is evident in the image by evaluating the circles that lose their shape through distortion at the poles, but maintain a consistent area. It is evident the projection distorts shapes and distances, meaning the projection is better used for global data, such as measuring deforestation. </p>

    <h2>World Equidistant Conic</h2>
    <p>This map is the first example of a conic projection, where the others have been using cylindrical or planar projections. I can see the map shows a view of the globe from the north or south pole, and the circles and lontitude/latitude lines do not create a full circle. As the grid space is angular, the area stays the same but shapes of countries and continents are altered.</p>

    <h2>North Pole Azimuthal Equidistant</h2>
    <p>Upon first glance, this map is almost identical to the map above, the World Equidistant Conic. Based on its name, I believe this map is considered azimuthal. This means the lines of true direction preserve direction as moving from the center point to other points is extremely accurate. The lines of this map close more space when compared to the world equidistant, leaving a smaller chunk of empty space at the top of the map. I would imagine this map is used to measure direction in the North Pole, or areas similar in location. </p>

    <h2>Aitoff World Projection</h2>
    <p>The Aitoff projection is a modified azimuthal projection. The map appears wide at the equator and shrinks in size as you move towards the poles. The grid lines are angular, which indicates the azimuthal projection even though the appearance of the map appears in a cylindrical projection. </p>

    <h2>World Robinson</h2>
    <p>This map shows the globe with a less dramatic emphasis on an enlarged middle, and rather a more modest scale and size of circles. Again, the distortion of countries gets bigger as you move towards the poles, deduced from examples like Greenland. The map appears to be using a cylindrical projection, so shape and area are fairly compromised due to the curvature on the side of the map.</p>

    <h2>World Behrmann</h2>
    <p>This map is similar to the WGS84 projection in that they are both cylindrical equal-area projections. The biggest difference lies in their standard parallels, in which the distortion of shape increases as you move along. This is evident by the circular shapes near the equator and ellipse-like shapes near the poles.</p>
