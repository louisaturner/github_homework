            <abstract>This GIS data set comprises a portion of the Gulf-Wide Information System (G-WIS) database for the entire coastal zone of Florida and the lower St. Johns River. These data characterize coastal environments and wildlife resources for environmental planning and natural resource management purposes. The G-WIS data include three main components: Shoreline habitats, sensitive biological resources, and human-use resources. This data set contains the information for INDEX (GT-Polygon).</abstract>
            <purpose>The G-WIS data are updated and re-formatted Environmental Sensitivity Index (ESI) data published from 1995-1997. The ESI data were collected, mapped, and digitized to provide environmental data for oil spill planning and response and other environmental planning and natural resource purposes. The Clean Water Act with amendments by the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 requires response plans for immediate and effective protection of sensitive resources.</purpose>

        <useconst>This is not a survey data set and should not be utilized as such. These data are not to be used for navigation. The ESI and G-WIS databases were developed to provide summary information on sensitive natural and human-use resources for the purposes of oil spill planning, environmental planning, and natural resource management. Although the G-WIS database should be a valuable planning and resource management tool, it should not be used to the exclusion of other pertinent data or information held by state or federal agencies or other organizations. Likewise, information contained in the database cannot be used in place of consultations with environmental, natural resource, and cultural resource agencies, or in place of field surveys. Also, this database and related map products should not be used for navigation. Recognize that the information contained in the G-WIS database represents known concentration areas or occurrences of natural, cultural, and human-use resources, but does not necessarily represent the full distribution or range of each species or resource. This is particularly important to recognize when considering potential impacts to protected resources, such as endangered species, wetlands, archaeological sites, etc. For more information or guidance on proper and improper uses of these data, please contact the Florida Marine Research Institute (FMRI) and Research Planning, Inc. Acknowledgement of the publishers, contributors, and sources listed in the Data_Set_Credit (below) and Lineage section of this document would be appreciated in products derived from or utilizing these data. Acknowledgement of the FWC-FWRI (Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission-Fish and Wildlife Research Institute) as the data source would be appreciated in any products developed from these data, and such acknowledgment as is standard for citation and legal practices for data source is expected by users of this data. Please cite the original metadata when using portions of the record to create a similar record of slightly altered data, such as reprojection. If any data are modified or adjusted, please share the edited information with FWC. Users should be aware that comparison with other data sets for the same area from other time periods may be inaccurate due to inconsistencies resulting from changes in mapping conventions, data collection, and computer processes over time.

        <datacred>This project was supported by the Florida Marine Research Institute (FMRI), Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC) and the, U.S. Department of Interiors Minerals Management Service (MMS). Tara Morgan with FMRI's Coastal and Marine Resource Assessment (CAMRA) program served as contract manager for the project. Henry Norris, Chris Friel, Phil Henderson, and other CAMRA staff contributed significantly to the project, as did many other FMRI staff and individuals from several state and federal agencies and other organizations. At Research Planning, Inc. (RPI), Scott Zengel was the project manager. Lee Diveley, Chris Locke and William Holton performed the data processing under the supervision of Mark White, GIS Manager. Rebecca Cox prepared the final metadata.</datacred>
