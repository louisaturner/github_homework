    <p>To find the percentage of rivers within densely populated and environmentally protected areas, I imported Florida data from 2019 that included a shapefile of all densely populated cities and areas. I also imported a dataset of the environmentally protected areas within Florida under the Environmental Sensitivity Index (ESI), and a shapefile of all Florida rivers. I then performed an intersection of the densely populated and environmentally protected areas, and then dissolved the county borders to look at the areas as a whole. I then used another intersection with the dissolved data and rivers to find the percentage of rivers that exist within both areas. Thus, 84% of 456 rivers are within a densely populated area and environmentally protected area.</p>
